# BAmazon-NodeJS-MYSQL

# Overview 

- In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store. This app will also use CLI.
Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

# Getting Started
